# electron-react-mobx-boilerplate

A quick-start for writing electron desktop apps using react for layout and mobx for state management.

This isn't best practice or well thought out or anything, I just thought it was worth saving an empty project with the named deps wired together.

## Usage

Clone it:
`$ git clone git@github.com:dhharker/electron-react-mobx-boilerplate.git`

Install deps:
```
$ cd electron-react-mobx-boilerplate
$ yarn # or npm install
```

Run it:
`$ npm run start`
